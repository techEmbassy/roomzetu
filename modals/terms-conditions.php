                            booking information and configuration.
                            To provide a level of protection against catastrophic application data failures, Roomzetu System’s
                            production databases undergo a backup at least once every 24 hours.
                            In the event of a failure of the primary database, Roomzetu RPM System will initiate a
                            rollback to the most recent backup. In this situation Roomzetu RPM System is not liable for any
                            data that cannot be restored from the backup.
